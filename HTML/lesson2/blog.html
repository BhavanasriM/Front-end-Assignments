        Cats are small animals that can be easily domesticated. They belong to
        the family Felidae and subfamily Felinae. Cats are the only domestic
        species in their family. The wild members of the family include lions,
        tigers, cougars, panthers, and leopards.

        Cats are true carnivores and need to eat meat to survive. They prey on
        rats, mice, lizards, snakes, rabbits, small fishes, small birds and
        other small animals in the wild. They usually eat many small meals
        throughout the day. Pet cats are known to love tuna and meats like
        chicken, turkey and beef. Most cat breeds can live for 12 to 18 years. A
        few cats have even lived for 25 to 30 years.

        Pet cats are known to love fishes like tuna, salmon, and sardines and
        meats like chicken, turkey, and beef. Cats are believed to be the only
        mammals who do not taste sweetness. There are many predators that prey
        on cats. Some larger predators include cougars, coyotes, raccoons, and
        wolves, while smaller animals like hawks, eagles, snakes, and owls also
        hunt cats.

        Cats have been living with humans for thousands of years. They were
        first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC. People valued them
        not just for their ability to kill rodents and snakes, but also as
        companions. Ancient cultures like Egypt saw them as sacred and
        worshipped them. In Persia, they were seen as the messengers of omens
        and magical beings. In Japan and China, cats symbolise blessings, good
        luck and fortune, and their figurines are often displayed in
        storefronts. According to estimates, there are around 220 million owned
        and 480 million stray cats today.
